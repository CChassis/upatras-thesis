Recent advances in the utilization of semi or fully autonomous platforms have created an emerging area of interest regarding their utilization in various aspects of  applications. Despite that fact, network connectivity, a crucial part to the successful application of their benefits, is still in early research stages. 
In this work, an overview of current trends and technologies regarding cellular networks is presented, followed by a detailed description of a system architecture that aims to showcase the feasibility of a remote-controlled vehicle over a network. Emphasis has been given to engineering a complete end-to-end system that is comprised of primarily open-source components, while being forwards compatible in regards to experimental or commercial 5G deployments.
